YouTube is about to surpass television as the most-watched entertainment medium in the world, with [1 billion views a day](http://fortune.com/2017/02/28/youtube-1-billion-hours-television/). It’s no wonder why so many school IT directors spend so much time and effort trying to make YouTube a safer place for students.

YouTube and other streaming video sites offer an incredible variety of educational resources for educators and students. They also offer plenty of videos that aren’t appropriate for schools — distracting content such as TV shows and movies, and graphic content including porn, extremist propaganda, and violence.

Four hundred hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute, which is why YouTube has limited capabilities to police its content, relying heavily on users to find and report dangerous content. Sites like Vimeo operate similarly.

Now, there’s a better way for schools to handle streaming video: Smart Play. We announced Smart Play yesterday at ISTE 2017, and it’s the result of months of research and development into how to make YouTube and Vimeo safe, educationally enriching places for students.

##### Here are five things to know about Smart Play, available in the next release candidate of [Web Filter 3: Longhorn](http://www.lightspeedsystems.com/longhorn) and coming soon to [Relay for Chrome](http://www.lightspeedsystems.com/relay/).

###### 1. Smart Play enables access to millions of videos.

Smart Play uses proprietary, machine-learning technology to find YouTube and Vimeo videos that are appropriate for education. (These videos are also accessible if they’re embedded on other websites.) Smart Play identifies and opens access to millions of videos — 28 million, as of this morning.


###### 2. Smart Play’s database gains millions more videos each day.

The more videos we add to Smart Play’s database, the smarter it gets at identifying appropriate content, and the faster it grows. Tomorrow morning, our database will have grown by about 2 million videos!


###### 3. There’s no need for block/allow lists or YouTube’s restricted modes.

Until now, solutions for school YouTube use included:
  - Allowing all streaming video, leaving users open to inappropriate content and making CIPA compliance basically impossible
  - Blocking all streaming video, limiting educational opportunities
  - Allowing streaming video and building a custom list of blocked sites, which is incredibly time-consuming
  - Blocking streaming video and maintaining a list of allowed sites, which is also time-consuming
  - Managing a custom library of allowed videos, which is time-consuming for IT and confusing for users
  - Allowing YouTube categories on a case-by-case basis or enabling a restricted mode, which counts on YouTube’s self-reported categorizations to be accurate (and many aren’t)

With Smart Play, you don’t have to utilize any of these methods to offer safe YouTube and Vimeo access to students.
