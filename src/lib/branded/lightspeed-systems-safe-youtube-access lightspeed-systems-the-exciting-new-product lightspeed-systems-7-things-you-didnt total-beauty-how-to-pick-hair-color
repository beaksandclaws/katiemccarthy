ENSURE SAFE, EASY ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL VIDEOS

Be confident in what you use.

Video streaming sites like YouTube are increasingly important to education, especially for K-12 students. Online video content can help reach visual learners; engage students at a variety of grade and reading comprehension levels; and make important educational concepts real for young people who are already accustomed to consuming information in a multimedia format.

These are just a few of the reasons why YouTube’s Education channel is one of its most popular. To wit, Forbes recently reported that videos in the Education category are viewed twice as o en as those in the ever-popular Pets & Animals category.

Dig into some of the channels creating educational video content and you can see why students and educators alike love using these resources for learning. Consider Khan Academy’s channel, which boasts 3.4 million subscribers; 1.27 billion (and counting) views; and a plethora of videos on math, science, economics, computing and the arts.

Although video streaming sites have plenty to o er in the mobile-learning age, they also create plenty of challenges for teachers, administrators and school IT departments. Video content sites are rife with pornography, extremist propaganda, violence, profanity and other disturbing and inappropriate content.

Although such videos o en violate acceptable use policies, YouTube relies on users to ag unsafe content so it can be removed — if it’s removed at all. Video categories are also user-selected, making it easy for explicit videos to y under the radar.

With so much user-generated video content available online, how can you protect your schools, keep students focused, comply with policies like the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA), manage your limited bandwidth, and also give students access to the multimedia learning opportunities they need?
