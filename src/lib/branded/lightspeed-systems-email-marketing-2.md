Katie, not all content filters are created equal. **If your school filter doesn’t have these five things,** you’re missing out on essential information for keeping your network safe.

1. **AI-driven database.** A smart, robot-powered database that gets more accurate each day and updates categorizations in real time

2. **Continuous user identification.** The ability to ID users across networks, even if they switch devices, for accurate reporting and policy application

3. **Dynamic reporting engine.** Comprehensive, drill-down reporting with detailed visibility into Google searches and YouTube video activity

4. **Flexible deployment.**  Multiple hosting options so you can choose what’s best for your district: cloud-only, appliance-based, or private cloud

5. **Robust mobile filtering.** On or off the school network, your users get fast access to the internet
