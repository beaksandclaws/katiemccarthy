Each year, the beauty industry spends boatloads of cash on the research and development of new gadgets. And, we happen to be in a golden age of beauty technology. Not only are billion-dollar brands in on the game, with the help of crowdfunding initiatives like Kickstarter, entrepreneurs now have more opportunities than ever to get ambitious beauty gizmos to market.

So who reaps the benefits from this technological wave? You — that is, if you want gorgeous skin, makeup, hair, nails, teeth, or all of the above. In recent months, there’s been a steady rollout of new, tech-y goodies to make you look better, faster — and I’m here to report on some of the best.

Here are 10 new beauty gadgets — from a $15 hair-removal innovation to a nearly $500 breakthrough facial device — to be excited about right now.

#### Temptu Air Cordless Makeup Airbrush Device

**What it is:** Temptu is responsible for bringing professional-quality airbrush makeup to the masses, inspiring countless #flawless Instagram posts in recent years. But the cumbersome setup of its first- and second-generation machines — with boxy, plug-in compressors and hoses — made them pretty impractical for daily use. The Temptu Air shrinks this technology and puts it in the palm of your hand. And it’s cordless; just power it up with the included USB charger.

**How it works:** Load the gadget with an Airpod — a bullet containing liquid foundation, highlighter, bronzer, or blush (which doubles as lip color) — and get brushing. Intimidating as the device looks, proper technique is really simple to pick up: Just pull the trigger lightly to spray the makeup, applying in quick, circular motions a few inches from the skin until you build the coverage you need. I found that the spot-conceal setting works best for undereyes and larger patches of discoloration. If you need to cover small blemishes or dark spots, try dabbing a lip or concealer brush in the makeup and applying by hand. Utterly #flawless, indeed.

#### Amika Movos Wireless Styler

**What it is:** Imagine never having to spend another minute detangling your blow-dryer and flat-iron cords. Well, the moment is here. Meet Movos, one of the only full-size cordless stylers on the market. The titanium-plated, energy-efficient flat iron can heat up to 400 degrees fahrenheit and function cordlessly for 15 to 30 minutes. Far-infrared heat and negative ions help prevent moisture loss from hair, ensuring it stays soft and sleek.

**How it works:** Not gonna lie: Those tutorialson creating beachy waves with a flat iron used to make me scratch my head. But with the Movos, suddenly I feel like an old pro. The wireless design offers total freedom of movement and the smooth, rounded-edge plates glide through hair without tugging. I’m ready to chuck my trusty, wired flat iron for good. Major points for the charging dock, which stows the iron vertically to make the most of bathroom storage space — and looks modern on a vanity, too.

#### Le Mini Macaron Gel Manicure Kit

**What it is:** At-home gel manicures, though pretty economical compared to in-salon treatments, are elaborate affairs. Most kits require using a clunky lamp, base coat, top coat, primer, curing solution, and so on. Le Mini Macaron, funded through Kickstarter, was designed to streamline DIY gel manicures. Just apply a coat of colored polish and stick fingers, one at a time, in the macaron-shaped LED lamp for 30 seconds, repeat with a second coat, and you’re done. (Each kit contains a bite-sized lamp, charger, gel polish, cuticle stick, nail file and 10 remover pads.)

**How it works:** TBH, the product’s too-cute packaging and insanely low price made me seriously underestimate this fabulous beauty value. The included polish is thick and easy to control during application and the process of painting and curing one nail at a time allows you set the polish before it has a chance to bleed into your cuticles. It took just 30 minutes to give myself a glossy red manicure as durable and professional-looking as any salon gel mani. And the teeny-tiny lamp fit easily into my toiletry bag on a trip out of town.

Le Mini Macaron Gel Manicure Kit, $35, available at [Le Mini Macaron](http://www.leminimacaron.com/#!product/prd15/4250674775/cassis---gel-manicure-kit).

#### Clarisonic Smart Profile Sonic Brush

**What it is:** You may already have a cleansing brush in your routine, but the Smart Profile is undoubtedly tech-ier than the one you’ve been using. This souped-up, multitasking brush is built to cleanse and exfoliate your face, body, andfeet. The Smart Profile functions with any of Clarisonic’s brush heads, but if you use a “smart” head, the device reads an embedded chip to deliver different speeds and sensations.

**How it works:** If you attach the Smart Dynamic facial brush, you get four 30-second cleansing intervals of light-to-medium intensity. If you attach the Smart Turbo Body brush, your cleansing session is peppered with sonic bursts for a massage-like experience. If you prefer to customize your cleansing routine, the manual mode features four speeds — five if you count the bonus Turbo setting, which makes the brush pulse so intensely it sounds like it’s rocketing into space. Another upgrade from old Clarisonic models: When the brush head has reached the end of its life — because who the heck remembers to replace it every three months? — a light on the handle illuminates.

#### Sphynx Travel Razor

**What it is:** Shaving is a pretty simple part of your beauty routine — unless, of course, 10 minutes in a spacious, hot shower is absolutely not happening. The next time you go on an extended glamping trip or book a last-minute after-work date, consider the Sphynx. Yet another beauty invention made possible through Kickstarter, this on-the-go razor packs everything you need to shave into one convenient sphere: water, moisturizing soap, a blade, and a spare.

**How it works:** Open up the Sphynx to find a refillable spray bottle of water; press a button and twist to find a slim bar of soap; twist again to reveal your razor. (There’s a bonus blade right behind it.) If you’re hooked on your Venus, the single-blade razor in the Sphynx is a bit of a downgrade and tricky to navigate over the knees. But I was pretty impressed by the no-rinse soap and targeted spray action of the tiny water bottle. If you’re not roughing it on vacation, you’re probably better off with a traditional razor. But if a shower isn’t on the menu, the Sphynx saves the day.

#### T3 Whirl Trio Interchangeable Styling Wand

**What it is:** Unless you’re one of those roll-out-of-bed, woke-up-like-this babes (kudos, BTW), you probably own more than one curling iron or wand. But this T3 will cut your bathroom clutter with a genius proposition: a curling wand with interchangeable barrels. For the price of two regular T3 curling wands, the Whirl Trio comes with a base iron and three attachments: a 1.25 to 0.75-inch tapered barrel, a one-inch straight barrel, and a 1.5-inch straight barrel.

**How it works:** The base locks in each barrel with a mechanism similar to that of a high-end camera lens, so the wand feels super sturdy in spite of the fact that it takes about two seconds to attach or detach. By changing up the barrels, you get major styling variety. The tapered barrel creates beachy waves; the one-inch barrel, princess-y spiral curls; the 1.5-inch barrel, tons of body with a little bend. In sleek white with rose gold hardware, it’s probably the most glamorous curling iron — make that irons — you’ve ever owned. Also cool: If you prefer barrels with clips, you can purchase those separately, too.

#### Sultra The Vixen Volumizing Dryer Brush

**What it is:** Women will fork over good money to avoid blow-dryer-induced arm fatigue (probably a reason your salon blowout is so expensive). Enter: The Vixen, a luxury hot air brush combining a 1,000-watt ionic blow-dryer with a ceramic-barrel round brush. It generates negative ions and far-infrared heat for faster drying, which, in turn, causes less damage to hair.

**How it works:** While the Vixen is a little tedious to use on thoroughly damp hair (try rough-drying with your usual blowdryer first), I was pleased to see it took only nine minutes to finish blowing out my long, medium-thick hair. The Vixen might be even better at styling dry hair — it takes just a few seconds to add a polished flip or a bit of volume to otherwise lank, blah hair. Coarse- or curly-haired ladies will love the brush’s smooth, no-tangle bristles, which may not have enough grip for fine-haired gals.

Sultra The Vixen Volumizing Dryer Brush, $130, available at [Target](http://www.target.com/p/sultra-the-vixen-volumizing-dryer-brush/-/A-31170440).

#### Foreo Issa Toothbrush

**What it is:** With its fluid shape and cheerful color selection, the Foreo Issa will surely be the best-looking electric toothbrush to ever grace your bathroom countertop. Designed for those with sensitive teeth and gums or gum recession — which are prone to damage by too-harsh brushing — it gently cleans with a combination of high-intensity pulsations and nonabrasive, nonporous silicone bristles.

**How it works:** The Issa is the closest thing to getting a mouth massage, gliding over teeth and gums without the slightest bit of irritation — pretty remarkable, considering that clinical studies show it cleans just as effectively as a scratchy manual toothbrush. If you prefer a deep, plaque-busting clean, the silicone bristles may not offer intensity you need. However, brushing with the [Hybrid Replacement Brush Head](https://www.foreo.com/issa-hybrid-brreplacement-brush-head) ($20), made with a combo of silicone and PBT polymers, may do the trick. Bonus: The low buzz of the Issa makes other electric toothbrushes sound like tiny weed whackers by comparison.

#### Tria Age-Defying Eye Wrinkle Correcting Laser

**What it is:** Tria Beauty changed the face of skin care last year when it launched the first at-home, FDA-cleared fractional skin laser — one of the most powerful non-invasive technologies for treating the signs of aging. The brand recently introduced a pocket-size version specifically designed to treat undereye lines and crow’s feet. According to Tria’s clinical research, 85% of people who used the gadget for two minutes a day for eight weeks saw improvement in fine lines and wrinkles.

**How it works:** Rubbed in small circles on the undereye area and just outside the corner of the eye, Tria’s laser sends targeted beams of light into the skin to trigger the production of collagen and elastin, smoothing skin texture. If that sounds like an intense process, it is: The pain was, at first, enough to take my breath away, and a bit of redness and dryness from the first treatment session persisted for more than 24 hours. Luckily, subsequent sessions were much less painful and the side effects less obvious. And once I glimpsed the amazing before/after photos (Google them!), I was ready to give this product a permanent place in my skin-care routine.

#### Ziip Nano Current Skincare Device

**What it is:** You’ve probably heard of microcurrent facials, which harness electrical energy to tone, plump, brighten, and smooth skin by stimulating the growth of collagen and elastin. For years, esthetician-to-the-stars Melanie Simon has used a similar technology — nano current — to lift clients’ skin and zap acne-causing bacteria. She recently packaged this technology into the Ziip, a personal nano-current device that integrates with an iPhone app to deliver the skin-care treatment protocol you need.

**How it works:** Navigate the brand’s free iPhone app to choose the appropriate “electrical cocktail,” designed to treat the signs of aging; eye-area puffiness, fine lines, and dark circles; or acne. In a bit of digital magic, the app wirelessly sends your treatment of choice to your Ziip device. Once you fire up the device, simply apply a conductive gel (included with the device purchase) to your face and glide the Ziip’s two metal probes over it in circular motions. We noticed an extra-big tingle over two blemishes during the Total Clearing program, said to be an indication that the current is killing acne-causing bacteria. Coincidence or no, the pimples were gone the following morning.
